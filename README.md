# DielectricModels4WetSnow
This repo contains code for evaluating 10 microwave dielectric mixing models to estimate liquid water amount (LWA) in wet snow/firn using L-band radiometry. The study focuses on the Greenland Ice Sheet's percolation zone to support accurate modeling of effective permittivity for LWA retrieval.
