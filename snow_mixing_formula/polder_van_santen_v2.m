function eps_eff  = polder_van_santen_v2(frac_volume, e0, eps, inclusion_shape)
% """ Calculates effective permittivity of snow by solution of quadratic Polder Van Santen equation for spherical inclusion.
%
% :param frac_volume: Fractional volume of inclusions
% :param e0: Permittivity of background (default is 1)
% :param eps: Permittivity of scattering material (default is 3.185 to compare with MEMLS)
% :param depol_xyz: [Optional] Depolarization factors, spherical isotropy is default. It is not taken into account here.
% :param length_ratio: Length_ratio. Used to estimate depolarization factors when they are not given.
% :param inclusion_shape: Assumption for shape(s) of brine inclusions. Can be a string for single shape, or a list/tuple/dict of strings for mixture of shapes. So far, we have the following shapes: "spheres" and "random_needles" (i.e. randomly-oriented elongated ellipsoidal inclusions).
%     If the argument is a dict, the keys are the shapes and the values are the mixing ratio. If it is a list, the mixing_ratio argument is required.
%     :param mixing_ratio: The mixing ratio of the shapes. This is only relevant when inclusion_shape is a list/tuple. Mixing ratio must be a sequence with length len(inclusion_shape)-1. The mixing ratio of the last shapes is deduced as the sum of the ratios must equal to 1.
%     :returns: Effective permittivity
